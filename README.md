itunesFestivalScraping
======================

Scrapes the iTunesFestival.com streams. Not very user-friendly. Needs Requests installed. Pass the initial playlist file URL (everything after the .com), the name of the file, the cookies, and the X-Playback-Session-Id as arguments to the script (you'll need to get those out of the requests iTunes/Safari/iOS makes to the iTunes Festival site for streaming), and follow the instructions in the script. (the cookies and session-id are optional; there's one from a capture i made of a stream, but it may not work)
