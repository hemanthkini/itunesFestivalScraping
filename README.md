itunesFestivalScraping
======================

Scrapes the itunesFestival streams. Not very user-friendly. Needs Requests installed. Pass the initial playlist file URL, the cookies, and the X-Playback-Session-Id as arguments to the script (you'll need to get those out of the requests iTunes/Safari/iOS makes to the iTunes Festival site for streaming), and follow the instructions in the script.
